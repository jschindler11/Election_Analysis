## Election-Audit Summary

This script can be used for any election. There are options to modify the script. We can modify the script to include any number of decimal places in the percentage of total votes (our audit only provides the percentage of total votes to the nearest tenth, but we can modify the script to calculate the percentage vote to the nearest hundredth, thousandth, etc). We can also modify the script to determine not only the county with the largest voter turnout, but also the county with the lowest voter turnout.
